# 👋 Hi, I'm Anthony (Ant)

I'm a Junior Software Developer transitioning from a mechanical engineering background into tech.  
My experience across rail, aviation, and automotive industries has given me strong problem-solving skills, technical precision, and the ability to work confidently in high-stakes environments.

I recently completed the **Northcoders Web Development Bootcamp**, where I focused on JavaScript, full-stack development, and modern tooling. I'm now building projects to strengthen my skills and working toward my first developer role.

## 💼 Professional Background (Short Version)

Before software development, I worked in:

- **Data roles** using SQL, Jira, VBA, and C# for automation and issue resolution
